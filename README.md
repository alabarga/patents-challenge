# Patents classification challenge

This Kaggle-style data challenge organised by professor Alexandre Gramfort took place in early 2016 during my second year at Telecom ParisTech. We had to classify patents that were either granted or rejected thanks to features such as the language of the patent, its technology sector, its number of investors or its filing date.
