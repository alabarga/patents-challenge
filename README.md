# Patents classification challenge

The goal of the data challenge was to classify patents, that were either granted or rejected, thanks to features such as the language of the patent, its technology sector, its number of investors or its filing date.

Most of the variables were esoteric to people outside the patents world, it was therefore complicated to come up with new variables.

## My approach

The iPython notebook contains everything about my submission and is thoroughly commented to let you follow how I tackled this challenge.

## About the challenge

This Kaggle-style data challenge organised by professor Alexandre Gramfort took place in early 2016 during my second year at Telecom ParisTech.

With a final submission score of 0.7205 (AUC metric), this project finished second among 71 participants.
